    <h3>Copycat</h3>
    <p><b>Project</b><br>
    Passion project to create a smarter, machine-learning and OCR-based app for screenshots.</p>
    <p><b>Role</b><br> 
    Everything from  user research to UX and UI design</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I'm obsessed with screenshots. I take them because I like to have quick access to any
    important notes or any recipes when I'm shopping for ingredients at the store. The problem with screenshots is that they
    can be difficult to organize and they look terrible in my camera roll.</p>

    <p>I knew that there are apps that have some OCR features, but nothing specific to screenshots. I wanted an app that leveraged
    machine learning to categorize screenshots and also made my screenshots look good, not disruptive. So I decided to take it
    upon myself to prototype something that could do what I wanted.</p>

    <p>I started some competitive research to see how others were leveraging OCR. I created a deck with UI and UX comparisons of other apps <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sclayton11/ocrscreenshot-app-competitive-research?ref=" target="_blank">(via Slideshare)</a>, as well as 
    comparison chart.</p>

    <!--<iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/nb14Hyb9jFQixO" width="75%" height="50%" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>-->

    <p><a href="img/competitive-chart.png" data-lightbox="competitive"><img src="img/competitive-chart.svg"></a></p>

    <p>Just to make sure that my time would be well-spent in creating this app, I created a <a href="https://parser.typeform.com/to/ox3Qix"
    target="_blank">survey using Typeform</a> asking people how frequently they took screenshots, what they took screenshots of as well as
    what they like and dislike about screenshots. I raffled off an Amazon gift card to entice more people to take the survey.</p>

    <p>After I got the results back, I dissected them and <a href="https://github.com/saraclay/Screenshot-Habits" target="_blank">
    put them on GitHub</a>. The insights from the survey were really fascinating, and showed me that this would be a project worth doing.</p>

    <p>People had a lot to say about screenshots...</p>

    <p><ul style="text-align:justify">
    <i>The good</i>
    <li>"Easy to copy large blocks of text, particularly formatted text."</li>
    <li>"Easy and most authoritative (straight from the source) way to copy and share info."</li>
    <li>"Very quick and easy; know where the shots will be saved (photos); can access info offline; in the case of e-mail receipts/confirmations, you can see info as it was originally presented w/o formatting errors like you might get with copy and paste."</li><br>

    <i>The bad</i>
    <li>"May get lost in photo album. Also pretty weird to see random screenshots in the sea of other photos."</li>
    <li>"Can't crop in real-time (like OS X drag tool). No native annotation tools. Difficult to search against (i.e. in Google Photos)."</li>
    <li>"A lot of the time, they look pretty sloppy (but that's more from an aesthetics perspective). Also, if you screenshot an article to send, the receiver misses out on context."</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Looking back at the survey data, I came up with three personas that were described.</p>

    <a href="img/personas.png" data-lightbox="personas"><img src="img/personas.svg"></a>

    <p>From there, I started working on wireframes based on how these personas would interact with the app.</p>

    <a href="img/copycat-wireframes.png" data-lightbox="wireframes"><img src="img/copycat-wireframes.svg"></a>

    <p>Now that the wireframes were in, I needed to flesh them out before putting a prototype in front of people.
    I decided to use Invision for this task, which I usually choose when testing user flow.</p>

    <p>This project is still in progress - check back for more updates.</p>
