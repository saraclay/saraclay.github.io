<p>I'm obsessed with screenshots. I take them because I like to have quick access to any recipes or notes. But over time, screenshots have taken over my camera roll, and make it look awful the way they're automatically organized. I wanted to come up with a way to save my screenshots neatly and without having to think much of it. </p>

</center>

<p>To make sure that time would be well spent on this project, I had 55 people <a href="https://parser.typeform.com/to/ox3Qix" target="_blank">fill out a survey</a> asking questions about their screenshot habits. The full results are on <a href="https://github.com/saraclay/Screenshot-Habits" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, but to summarize, people love screenshots because they are accessible offline, they can capture a lot of text, and are the easiest way to share a lot of information. On the other hand, people find that editing features for screenshots are limited, they get lost easily, and they look sloppy (in camera rolls).</p>

<center><p><b>Problem:</b></center> 
<p>While screenshots are accessible and help to share information easier, they can be difficult to organize and edit.</p>
</p>

<center><p><b>Solution:</b></center> 
<p>An app that uses image content analysis (such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" target="_blank">Google's Vision API</a>) would make organizing screenshots less of a hassle. This app could also display screenshots in full-height, as opposed to square dimensions, and would offer powerful OCR and screenshot-editing capabilities.
</p>

<p>From there, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/sclayton11/ocrscreenshot-app-competitive-research?ref=" target="_blank">I conducted competitive research</a> to get inspiration for interactions and created personas based on the survey data I collected. (Note that the people in these personas are made-up). I also created wireframes for scenarios.</p>

<p>For the look and feel of the app, I knew I wanted something fun. Screenshots have the reputation of being "aesthetically displeasing," so I thought a cute camera mascot with feline features would brighten up what might otherwise be a bit of a boring, utilitarian app. </p>

<p>Wanting to get feedback for this app, I created hi-fi comps of the screens and put them into Invision where I could test for flow logic. You can play around with the prototype <a href="https://invis.io/D5B82YAA8" target="_blank">here</a>. Based on the feedback, I made changes to the app, and what you see is the current version - though <a href="mailto:hi@saraclayton.co" target="_blank">feel free to let me know</a> if you find something that could make it better.</p>

<center><p><b>Learnings:</b></center>I had a lot of fun working on Copycat. For a project with so many screens, I wish I had originally started with Sketch. Instead, I had started with Illustrator but ended up having to scrap all of it for Sketch. Thankfully, Sketch was definitely the better tool going forward. </p>
