<hr />
<p>In partnership with Microsoft Philanthropies, the Microsoft.com team was invited to work on a pilot program with non-profits where teams at Microsoft could spend a portion of their work hours doing pro-bono work. </p>

<p>Our project was to help the Hearing, Speech and Deaf Center (HSDC) attain its main goal for FY17 - to increase awareness of their services within the local and greater community.</p>

<p>I was tasked with recruiting and managing a group of volunteers from across the company. While I had recruited volunteers with a wide range of skills (i.e. marketing, research, etc.), we also realized - through interviews and web analytics - there was a strong need for a website redesign.</p>

<p>During our interview with select directors of HSDC, they mentioned that their current WordPress site was difficult to work with and that it was not responsive. Based on website analytics, we found that most people initially came to the page to find out more on how to volunteer and to learn more about the services they offer. During that process, we also saw that their "404" page was the fifth most visited page overall on their site - never a good sign. From there, three-fifths of the top pages visited after were related to contacting the center.</p>

<p>From personal observation, there was so much content to wade through that we were <i>drowning</i> in content. We also brought in our accessibility team for user testing and used three different scenarios to guide them through site navigation. From these sessions, we found that much of the site would fail a standard accessibility test.</p>

<center><p><b>Problem:</b></center> 
<p>Website visitors have a hard time finding what they want on the website because of the sheer amount of content, distracting interactions and overall user experience across all devices. Due to these issues with the website, HSDC is not capturing all possible leads to the webiste.</p>
<hr />
<center><p><b>Solution</b></center> 
<p>A website that is easy to navigate with defined categories, succinct content and device responsiveness. This website should also be easy to use from a site administrator's perspective, complete with pre-made post elements.</p>
<hr />
<p>We started out by going through the whole site, making note of all the pages, then narrowing down the best categories for as much of the content as we could consolidate. Then we re-organized their information architecture.</p>

</center>

<p>From there, we brainstormed the content that would go into these sections by working on user scenarios and went on to create wireframes.</p>

<center><p><b>Learnings:</b></center>Like a lot of projects at Microsoft, I do wish we go to use Sketch for this project - we could've saved a lot of back and forth that way. While we encouraged the center to socialize the design earlier on, some of the feedback came in later in the process, but we were able to adjust for most of the feedback. There's a lot more I would have wanted us to do, but with a May timeline, we were limited. Other additions would include helping them build a better scheduling system or a custom donation platform.</p>
