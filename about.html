<p>I started coding websites when I was 12 years old, making the most out of the text editor on Neopets.com. I thought bringing a webpage to life on a real, living site was an amazing thing.</p>

<p>When I got my first iPhone in college - an iPhone 4S to be exact - the same kind of fascination struck me. With just one tap, I had the ability to open up a whole universe of Tweets, videos, or just about anything.</p>

<p>After graduating college, I landed a job at Microsoft doing product marketing for open source - a one-of-a-kind role and experience that I'm truly grateful about. Yet, while in marketing, I was still developing websites and sketching out app ideas on the side. It got to the point where I realized that perhaps that my 12-year-old self was onto something. So I decided to take the leap and switch into UX.</p>

<p>Once I started my first role in UX, I found that my backgrounds in marketing, journalism, and web development complemented what I was working on, and I've felt like this is a discipline I've been practicing for much longer than I've realized. It's exciting to be part of the changing face and increasing prominence and importance of design in all industries.</p>

<p>Outside of work and side projects, I'm obsessed with finding the best hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Seattle as well as cooking Japanese food - I'm 99% sure that I'll be opening either a small bento shop or a Japanese bakery someday. I also enjoy running and boxing and currently sing alto in The Acoustix, a Microsoft a cappella group.</p>
